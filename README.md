# Crowd Radar
Submission for Garuda Hacks 2020.

Crowd Radar is an andrid app that I created with 3 other team members for Garuda hacks. The app tracks crowds through location services, uses geo-fencing to calculate the number of people in the same building, and sends alerts when if there are too many people in the same building
